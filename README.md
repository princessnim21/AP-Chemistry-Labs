## Safety Demo Lab #5 - Poor Little Gummy! 8/23/22
Materials: 
> gas torch, torch stricker, test tube, test tube clamp, safety goggles, lab coat, fume hood, solid KClO3 (potassium chlorate), gummy bear

1. First, KClO3(s) was added to the test tube and heated up until it melted to a liquid.
2. Once melted, we used a stick to put the gummy bear into the test tube

#### KClO3 (potassium chlorate) + Gummy Bear (sugar)
> + violent reaction that lasted for a while (~30 seconds)
> + lots of smoke produced from a slightly purple flams
> + usually, supposed to make a "crying" sound, but it didn't for us

## Distillation 9/1/22
Materials: 
> condeser, tube attachments for water, stand + clamps, hot plate, beaker, flask, rubber stopper with holes and tube, matches, candles, splint wood, sink (access to water), fume hood, glass petri dish, wine, safety goggles (only Mr.Bender)

1. First, we poured some wine in a glass petri dish and tried to set it on fire using a match, candle, and splint wood. 
> Why? - Wine has alcohol in it, but it also has a lot of water, so it will not ignite

#### Distillation Set-Up:
> Distillation used to seperate mixtures of liquids by using the fact that they have different boiling points

Pour wine into a 500ml volumetric flask and put a stopper attached to another stopper via a tube that connects the two of them 

#### Condenser Set-Up::
